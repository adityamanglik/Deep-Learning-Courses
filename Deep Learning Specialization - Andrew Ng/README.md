This repository contains my solutions for all courses in the Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng on Coursera.
[https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning]

This repository also contains blank notebooks for each course along with my solutions in the respective directories.
You can replace the filled notebooks with empty ones and run a jupyter server to practise.
All images and codes have been checked for compilation.

I would strongly recommend paying for the courses on the parent websites.
To download all your programming assignments including all files and notebooks, follow the [steps outlined here](https://medium.com/@kalpeshnpatil/coursera-downloading-jupyter-workspace-files-10090191ca01).
